# Learning_Python

Welcome to "Learning_Python"! This repository is my personal learning space where I document my journey to master the Python programming language. As I navigate through the intricacies of Python, I'll be adding everything I learn right here, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

## About the Repository

This repository serves as a journal of my progress and a place to keep all my Python codes in one place. By sharing this repository, I hope to help others who are starting their journey in Python programming. The content here is limitless as I continuously learn and add more Python-related materials.

## Structure

|             Days             | Content |
| -----------------------------| ------- |
| [Day1](Learning_Python/Day1) | Basic print statements and arithmetic operations. |
| [Day2](Learning_Python/Day2) | Exploring various projects like Face Recognition, Flappy Bird Game, Jarvis Virtual Assistant, Love Calculator, and Snake Game to understand Python execution. |
| [Day3](Learning_Python/Day3) | Introduction to external modules like `pandas` and `scikit-learn`, and built-in modules like `hashlib`. |
| [Day4](Learning_Python/Day4) | Custom print function and more practice with print statements. |
| [Day5](Learning_Python/Day5) | Understanding comments, escape sequences, and more advanced print statement parameters. |
| [Day6](Learning_Python/Day6) | Exploring different data types including integers, floats, complex numbers, booleans, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, decimals, fractions, and arbitrary-precision integers. |
| [Day7](Learning_Python/Day7) | Simple calculator implementation demonstrating basic arithmetic operations. |
| [Day8](Learning_Python/Day8) | Enhanced calculator solution with detailed explanations. |

## How to Use

### Cloning the Repository

1. **To get started with this repository, you need to clone it to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:** <br><br>
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/laveshparyani/Learning_Python.git
<br>

2. **Navigating to a Specific Day** <br><br>
   Change your directory to the folder of the specific day you want to explore. For example, to navigate <br> to Day 1: <br><br>
   ```sh
   cd Learning_Python/Day1
<br>

4. **Running the Code** <br><br>
   Open the main.py file in your preferred code editor to review the code. To run the code, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can run the code by using the following command in your terminal:<br><br>
   ```sh
   python main.py
<br>

5. **Installing Necessary Libraries** <br><br>
   If the code requires any external libraries, you need to install them using pip. For example, to install pandas and scikit-learn, you would run: <br><br>
   ```sh
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
<br>

6. **Viewing the Output** <br><br>
   After running the main.py file, you can view the output directly in your terminal. If the code writes output to a file, you can open that file in your code editor to see the results.<br><br>

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code. This repository is a growing collection of my learning process, and I hope it serves as a helpful resource for you as well. <br><br>
